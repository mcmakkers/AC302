			<h3>Live, by Ableton</h3>
			<p>Ableton's unique factor is that it has a "session view", a way to record clips, then rearrange them on-the-go to make arrangements.</p>
			<h3>Logic Pro X, by Apple</h3>
			<p>This macOS-exclusive DAW is the leading competitior to Live. The full version is many hundred pounds cheaper than Ableton's, however this is probably because Apple devices are overpriced.</p>
			<h3>GarageBand, by Apple</h3>
			<p>This beginner-friendly DAW, which comes installed on every Apple device, is very likely the first DAW you have used. However, its lack of effects make it unviable to use professionally</p>
